# tempDataLogger
Hi all,
My name is Madhan kumar, I have done this temperature data logger as the part of the ECEN academy under the guidance of Balaji seshadree sir.

I done this project using the atmega2560 microcontroller unit (arduino mega2560 unit) without using any arduino inbuilt library functions (except for the SD card). In this project I have recorded the external temperature via the Analog pin present inside the MCU using it's internal ADC and store it in the SD card along with the time stamp and also display it via the LCD for every 20 seconds.

Thank you.
